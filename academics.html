	<p>The 2022-2023 school year has had its ups and downs. One great part of the schoool year was coming out of the covid lockdown and pandemic, and personally achieving honor roll status in the first semester of sophomore year. Some downs have been my academics in the seconds semester, as my grade has dropped.</p>
